Kassino is an old Italian fishing card game.

The dealer deals four cards to each player and lays four more face up on the table. Cards on the table are captured using cards from a playerâ€™s hand.
This is done by matching pairs (an 8 in your hand can take any 8 on the table), or by taking a combination of cards on the table that add up to 
a card in your hand (an 8 in your hand can take both a 2 and a 6 on the table). One card can also take many combinations off the table (an 8 in your hand 
can take an 8, 2, and 6 on the table all at once). Each card on the table may only be used for one combination (an 8 in your hand
cannot take a 2, 6 and a 6). You can only make one capture per turn

If a player cannot make a capture, he/she must place a card face up on the table. 

The jack, queen and king are considered 11, 12 and 13's. Any ace in a player's hand is worth 14, whereas aces on the table account for 14. 
There are two special cards in the game: the two of spades is 15 in a player's hand, but only 2 on the table. Similarly, the ten of diamonds is a 16 when held
and 10 on the table.

The game continues until each player is out of cards, at which point the player who has last made a capture gets the cards remaining on the table.

After this each pile of captured cards is counted up and each player's score is calculated.

Points are awarded accordingly:

	Most number of cards = 1 point
	Most number of spades = 2 points
	2 of spades = 1 point
	10 of diamonds = 1 point
	Aces = 1 point each

Players also earn a point every time they clear the table during the course of the game.
 
Rounds are played until anyone wins the game by reaching 16 points.
